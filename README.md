## Varta what?

Varta is a play on a Hindi word 'Vartalap', which translates to 'a conversation'. And Varta stands for exactly that. Varta is a web app designed to simplify blog creation and management by mimicking a CMS like Wordpress. However, JavaScript is Varta's nuts and bolts. Articles are stored as JSON objects on the backend, which can be invoked by a complemeting API.
